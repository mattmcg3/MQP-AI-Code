# MQPTensorflowAISoundRecognition
MQP Tensorflow AI Sound Recognition

Install VS Code, Tensorflow, and Python (version 3.11)
Create new folder in VS Code
Create an environment by copying location of folder and adding \python -m venv "name of virtual environment". Activate this environment ($ source <venv>/bin/activate) and make sure you're working in it!
Within the folder, upload code here. I used ipynb files for the AI so that I could retrain/resave without reinstalling things, but organize how you want.
Work in the vr_w_application.ipynb file if you want to connect to the microphone. The other shows training data.
if installations are throwing errors, try (in command prompt) "pip install "whatever is throwing the error"" I had to do this with matplotlab and seaborn
run each code section. this will create "saved_model" folder, which will hold your AI for the live microphone voice/sound detection
still in virtual environment, run python code (in command prompt, "python main.py"
